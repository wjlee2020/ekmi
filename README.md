# Ekmi

I wanted a fresh start with Phoenix / LiveView's new version(s).

This is an app mainly for me and my wife's budget :)

## Uploaded Images (if any)

Any uploaded images will be deleted most likely within 24 hours.
Don't want to pay (any more than I have to) for s3.

## Feedbacks

If you do end up trying out the app, I would love some feedbacks!

Of course this app is still being worked on and so I'm sure you'll find a lot of oddities.
